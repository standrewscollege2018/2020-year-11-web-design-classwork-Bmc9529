      <h1>The United Kingdom</h1>
      <p>Living just north of London was perfect, as we were close enough to train into London for the day, but also had easy access to the M1 and M25.</p>
      <p>We could easily drive anywhere, and also had a train line passing directly through the town.</p>
      <h3>We tried to travel every weekend, and some of our highlights are below:</h3>
